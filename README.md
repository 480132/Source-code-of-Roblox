1. Visit the link above (you will need a github account)
2. Locate the terminal (It is down just drag it up)
3. Locate the code file "index.js" at the 12th line, it should say "const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080"
4. Change the port to whatever 4-number you want. NEVER USE PORT 8080.
5. Type "npm i && npm run start" or "npm run start"
6. change the port visibility to "public" NOTE: this will not work if the port is in "private" visibility.
7. Go to link and enjoy games!
