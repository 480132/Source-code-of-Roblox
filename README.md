#### What happened to Replit Deployment?

As of January 1st, 2024, Replit is [no longer free](https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes). Try GitHub Codespaces instead.

### GitHub Codespaces

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Click "Code" (green button) and then "Create Codespace on main."
3. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `npm i && npm run start`.
4. Respond to the application popup by clicking "Make public."
   > Make sure you actually click the "Make public." button, or the proxy won't function properly.
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `npm run start`

### Solution for if there is no popup.

1. Run `npm i`, and before `npm run start`, prepend `$env:PORT=8080;`, replacing 8080 with another port. For example, `$env:PORT=6969; npm run start`.
2. Go to the ports tab, Click Forward A Port, And type the port number.
3. Right-click Visibility and set Port Visibility to Public.
